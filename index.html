                <p>I am returning to school to change careers.  I have a 
                    BSN and started out my career as a Labor and Delivery Nurse. I have three children, ages 21, 19, 19, 
                    and, yes, I have twins. I was a stay at home mom for the last 18 years. I loved
                    being a nurse, I loved being a mom, and I love coding!
                </p>

                <p>I enjoy building things...I enjoy the satisfaction of seeing my vision come to
                        life on the page. I am determined, detail-oriented, and definitely excited about
                      the future.
                </p>
